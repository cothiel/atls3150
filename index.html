    <p >Below is an image of a cat that looks just like my cat. I would've put an image of my cat but I don't have any where I can copy the link address. I know I can add images from my computer, but I wanted to follow the exact instructions. Funnily enough, as I was making this web page, my cat jumped on my computer and accidentally turned it off! If you'd like to learn more about tabby cats, here is a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabby_cat">link</a></strong></p>
